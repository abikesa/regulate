# ~/.ssh/id_innovateregulate

Summary:

1. Innovation: training students, robots; retraining workers, software
2. Regulation: America already lagging by here, yet leading in innovation; not surprising
3. Balance: not sure EU is anywhere in top 5 on AI but they're certainly no. 1
4. Falling behind: 
5. Innovate & let regulation catchup 

AI: Impact on Industry

1. Cat Zakrzewski, WP

   - A national tech policy correspondent at The Washington Post, where I focus on the relationship between the tech industry and global regulators. I lead The Post's coverage of the debate over how to regulate AI, as well as the legal and legislative battles over free speech online. I also serve as The Post's point person covering how the Biden administration is shaping tech policy. 

   - Have covered tech policy at The Post for five years, tracking antitrust, privacy and social media policy. I previously served as the first anchor of The Technology 202 newsletter, the daily guide to the intersection of technology and politics. 

   - Previously covered venture capital and startup news for WSJ Pro, the Wall Street Journal's premium news service for professionals. Before that, I wrote about policy news for TechCrunch. In 2017, I was named an Arthur F. Burns fellow and spent two months reporting in Berlin. 

   - Graduated from Northwestern University's Medill School, where I studied journalism with a concentration in political science. During college I served in various editorial roles for The Daily Northwestern. As a student, I wrote for the Boston Globe, TechCrunch, USA TODAY, the Chicago Sun-Times, UPI and Northwestern Magazine.

2. Don Beyer (D-VA), 73yo
   - Masters degree student in machine learning
   - Programming in Python3
   - Finds himself at center of AI policy debates
   - Started at George Mason 2 years ago
   - Bipartisan task force appointed by McCarthy
   - NIS framework is goldstandard for AI ethics; for government contracting with DoD
   - White House voluntary pledge for AI ethics by big companies
   - Don't really know how to regulate for now... 
   - `Existential risks`
   - Impact on job destruction: writers & actors strike
   - Goldman Sachs estimates 12m jobs will be destroyed by 2030
   - Responsibility for people left behind (retrain Americans, etc.)
   - Creative/destruction is how tech works so it will create new opportunities and folks need re-training
   - Failed with social media
   - *EU AI Act* is groundbreaking but inappropriate for our culture of innovation
   - Guard-rails that protect without stifling innovation
   - Agency-by-agency AI due-diligence rather than a new AI-specific agency (decentralized)
   - USA is 5% of global population and punches above its weight
   - So Nigeria, China, India, Russia, etc. will be important for international alignment
   - `The U.N. needs to step up to declare that this is a priority for the next decade`
   - Mistakes of delay have been committed by the UN in climate, nuclear, etc
   - Establishing a predominant position by a country willl make it harder for another country to catchup
   - Satelite data: 80% isn't looked at; AI could transform that and affect global defense systems!!
   - Ability to change the way we live: what drew me to AI
   - Steve Jobs said it best: its transforming Usain Bolts speed & endurance to Lance Amstrongs
   - Government curated quality dataset for everyone to develop models on
   - ChatGPT hallucinates a lot because of lack of quality control in training it

3. Barbara Humpton, President & CEO, Siemens USA
   - Industrial AI
   - Here with Brian Harrison, Senior director, Omniverse Digital Twins, Nvidia
   - Industrial vs. Consumer AI **POUVOIR**
   - Industrial: apply AI to process (e.g. train robot); safety bigger deal here
   - Customer: make it more human (e.g. chatGPT, virtual assistants), failure here isn't a big issue
   - Siemens: industrial-grade AI (acceptance testing, reliability & assurance, creating training datasets)
   - Warehouse: optimization in Amazon (move them around for storage but also for workers to pick from them)
   - `Perception systems` **VOIR**: robots picking and sorting packages to be shipped out
   - Creating industrial metaverse: Moore's law coming to industry (like with software)
   - `We now do everything digitally first before commiting concrete to building a factory (i.e., Simulation)`
   - Don't use for a year to then diagnose a problem; even assessing impact on environment, etc.
   - Simulation = Digital Twins? Interesting, but we should bring this to clinical practice


4. Jay Lee, Professor & Director, Industrial AI CEnter, University of Maryland at College Park
   - AI has been here for decades 
   - 40 years ago we used it but didn't talk about
   - With ChatGPT the populace is awakened (LLM for chatting ok)
   - Large Knowledge Models are what we should worry about 
   - LKM for sustainable, reliable AI space 
   - Professionals using knowledge
   - Used pre-programmed systems
   - Then rule-based systems
   - Network systems 
   - Individual & collaborative knowledge systems
   - `Transfer learning` for many machines **SAVOIR**: fleet of jet engines, wind turbines, driving vehicles
   - Can use the experience of one car to improve another 
   - We need to think about the `baseline`: stronger, better quality, environmental emission control, attracting the young
   - Need Technology (use), Tools (leverage), Talent (capability), more transparency
   - Education should touch on these three together as early as high school
   - Inspiration for younger generation will work if industry offers great exemplars
   - Talking to worried high school student about careers
      - AI is not about AI: its about actual implementations
      - So it makes things happen: `to do`
      - Before and after AI: way to inspire younger students
      - Thats how to excite the young because excitment and frenzy are contagious
   - Better baseline and bottomline for all products & services moving forward
   - Data-centric economy
      - We need to understand how to use data
      - Most curricula don't know much about data
      - How to find data, useful vs. usable, how do you define data quality, how do you engineer that
      - Business schools and high school will have to introduce these ideas
      - Data science courses never touch on the data bit
      - Generating `more valuable outcomes data`

5. Victorial Espinel, CEO, BSA, Software Alliance
   - Policy makers have been awakened like never before across the world
   - Chairs international working group of the committee 
   - Will be convening in D.C. Nov 19th; public welcome to attendd
   - UK AI summit in Nov.: multinational leaders engaging broad range of economies, not just high-income, etc
   - AI has global impacts and conversations need as many perspectives as possible
   - EU has moved really quickly and passed a bill: concerned the US falling behind on AI policy?
